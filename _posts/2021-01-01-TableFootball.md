The goal of this project was to implement an autonomous digital counter in a table football. This would detect when it was goal and show it to the user.

The project will be divided in the numerical displays, lcd display, user controls and uC to integrate everything.

The schematic and board of the numerical displays and of the detection method had to be designed.

<br> The following frameworks were used:
<ul>
  <li>KICad;</li>
  <li>Arduino.</li>
</ul>
