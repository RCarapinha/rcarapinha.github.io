<br> The navigation between scenes is made using a combination of buttons on the screan and the android navigation buttons.

The beginning of the tutorial is made by the detection of a marker in an automatic way.

<br> The following frameworks were used:
<ul>
  <li>Unity 3D,</li>
  <li>Vuforia,</li>
  <li>C#.</li>
</ul>

TBD:
<ul>
  <li>Implement in the classroom;</li>
  <li>Create 2 versions: A user and a developer one. The user version would be what we already have and the developer one we could take pictures of a target, create the circuit and then share with all the users;</li>
  <li>Make a PCB version: single-layer, dual-layer and multi-layer. Would be useful to check the size of designed PCB;</li>
  <li>Improve the visual presentation and implement more tutorials;</li>
  <li>Fix bugs.</li>
</ul>
