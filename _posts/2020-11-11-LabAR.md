Development of an AR application to aid in the assembly of breadboard circuits using Unity and Android.

![ProjectStructure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RCarapinha/LabAR/master/Images/ProjectStructure.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The navigation between scenes is made using a combination of buttons on the screan and the android navigation buttons.

The beginning of the tutorial is made by the detection of a marker in an automatic way.

The following frameworks were used:
- Unity 3D,
- Vuforia,
- C#.

TBD:
- Implement in the classroom;
- Create 2 versions: A user and a developer one. The user version would be what we already have and the developer one we could take pictures of a target, create the circuit and then share with all the users;
- Make a PCB version: single-layer, dual-layer and multi-layer. Would be useful to check the size of designed PCB;
- Improve the visual presentation and implement more tutorials;
- Fix bugs.
